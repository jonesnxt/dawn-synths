these are the parts that i use on my projects that i would recommend to anyone getting in to this sort of thing.

## microcontroller

i mostly use adafruit's itsybitsy m4 express in my builds, its pretty much the only microcontroller i know that can output two separate channels of analog signal. not having to use a dac for these projects makes everything so much simpler so i can't recommend this chip enough, plus its only $15.

## patch cables

winterbloom has these absolutely fantastic patch cables. super high quality and only the best colors :)

## potentiometers and jacks

a great spot to get the typical modular synth jacks and an array of potentiometer options, i use only 50k ohm linear potentiometers because i'm pretty much only plugging them into an analog input channel to read from directly and i can remap them in software, but if you want to actually use them for analog purposes i think you're supposed to get different kinds or something.

## other circuit components

adafruit is a long time favorite of mine, i first bought stuff from them eleven years ago and they have only continued to get better in that time. pretty much any additional lcd or button or switch that i use comes from here.

if i can't find a good option on adafruit, i usually end up here. they're pretty good. the boxes come from here and i quite like them.

\*any of these companies please sponsor me lmao
